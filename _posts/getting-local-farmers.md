Onesmas Ssekito, is a cassava farmer in Bukerere, Mukono district has for long been planting cassava and reaping from it. We met him to understand his experience with growing cassava, and to learn more about the cassava diseases that affect his garden. This interaction built a foundation for us to carry out further research on how to make it easier for farmers in remote areas to use technology to help them farm more efficiently.

Mr Onesmas,
