To build computation algorithms to detect and classify cassava diseases, we needed to first understand cassava diseases and their prevalence in Uganda. To do this, we went to the National Crops Resources Research Instritute (NaCCRI) located in Namulonge, about 24.3 kilometers from Makerere University, Kampala.

We interacted with several experts from NaCCRI, who explained to us why cassava is an important crop, and why more attention needs to be given to it. “Cassava is a security food crop and is one of the crops that can survive prolonged seasons of draught” said Dr. Chris Omongo, one of the experts we interviewed.

During this interview, we also learnt the different diseases that are affecting the cassava crops, the commonest ones included, cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD) and the Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD) spread by the white-fly vector – A small fly that lays it’s eggs beneath the cassava leaves, giving room for the growth of the disease causing viruses, which are spread when the flies feed on the cassava leaves. Other diseases that affect the cassava disease are Cassava Green Mite (CGM) and Cassava Bacterial Blight (CBB)
